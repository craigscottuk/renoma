TO DO!

- get the sanity image working
- useTranslations for the contact form fields and validations
- is it possible to have the headings in the dane contact to be updated server side form a json object without the useTranslations hook?
- add correct heading tags to kontakt from and header component... finalise margins and spacing

- meta stuff in the layout
- we need to get portable text installed and the document
- do something with this: "const OPTIONS = { next: { revalidate: 30 } };"
